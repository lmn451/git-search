Git Search for VS Code 🚀

👉 TL;DR: Find out who changed what and when in your codebase. Just make sure you're not the culprit you're looking for! 😉
What's This?

Git Search is your go-to VS Code buddy for spelunking through Git logs. It's like a time machine for your code - minus the flux capacitor.
Why It Rocks:

    Quick Git Log Searches: Uncover the "who-dunnit" of code changes in a snap.
    Direct Links to Commits: Jump straight from a search result to the actual commit in your remote repo.
    Smart Pagination: Got tons of results? No sweat, just page through them.
    Auto-Adapts to Your Repo: Works with your current workspace's Git setup. No config headaches.

Using It:

    Fire up the command palette, look for 'Show Git Search Panel'.
    Type your query, hit enter, and let the magic happen.
    Browse results, click commit links for details, or hit 'Load More' for more intel.
